## Introduction

This page serves as a bookmark hub for high-quality free resources I've found useful. It's organized by categories for easy navigation. Each entry includes a title, link, and a brief description to give context on why it's valuable. Feel free to suggest additions!
If you're just starting, I recommend scanning the categories that match your interests. These are mostly focused on web development, JavaScript, and related tools, but I'll expand as I discover more.

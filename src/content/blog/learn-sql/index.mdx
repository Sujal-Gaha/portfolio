## 1. Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with relational database management systems (RDBMS). It allows users to create, manage, manipulate, and retrieve structured data stored in tables.
Relational databases organize data into rows and columns, forming tables that can be related using keys.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Tables

A table is a collection of related data organized into rows (records) and columns (fields).

Example structure:

| id  | name  | email           |
| --- | ----- | --------------- |
| 1   | Alice | alice@email.com |

### 2.2 Schema

A schema defines how data is structured:

- Table names
- Column names
- Data types
- Constraints

### 2.3 Keys

- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row.
- **Foreign Key:** Links one table to another.
- **Composite Key:** Multiple Columns forming a unique key.

---

## 3. SQL Command Categories

### 3.1 DDL (Data Definition Language)

Defines database structure.

Commands:

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP
- TRUNCATE

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);
```

### 3.2 DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Manipulates data.

Commands:

- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

Examples:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age)
VALUES ('John', 20);
```

### 3.3 DQL (Data Query Language)

Retrieves data.

Command:

- SELECT

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

### 3.4 DCL (Data Control Language)

Controls permissions.

Commands:

- GRANT
- REVOKE

### 3.5 TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Manages transactions.

Commands:

- COMMIT
- ROLLBACK
- SAVEPOINT

---

## 4. Data Types

Common SQL data types:

- INTEGER
- FLOAT/DECIMAL
- CHAR/VARCHAR
- TEXT
- DATE
- BOOLEAN

---

## 5. Constraints

Used to enforce rules:

- NOT NULL
- UNIQUE
- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY
- CHECK
- DEFAULT

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

---

## 6. Filtering Data

### 6.1 WHERE Clause

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 18;
```

### 6.2 Operators

- `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- BETWEEN
- LIKE
- IN

---

## 7. Sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

---

## 8. Aggregation Functions

- COUNT()
- SUM()
- AVG()
- MIN()
- MAX()

Example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
```

---

## 9. GROUP BY & HAVING

```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

## 10. Joins

Used to combine tables.

Types:

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL JOIN

Example:

```sql
SELECT orders.id, users.name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN users
ON orders.user_id = users.id;
```

---

## 11. Indexes

Improve query performance.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name
ON students(name);
```

---

## 12. Transactions & ACID

ACID Properties:

- **Atomicity:** All or nothing transactions
- **Consistency:** Valid State maintenance
- **Isolation:** Transactions do not affect each other
- **Durability:** Permanent changes after commitment

---

## 13. Views

Virtual tables.

```sql
CREATE VIEW adult_students AS
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18;
```

---

## 14. Stored Procedures & Triggers

Automated SQL logic executed on events.

---

## 15. Use Cases

- Banking systems
- E-commerce
- School management
- Inventory systems

---

## 16. Advantages

- Structured data integrity
- Strong transactions
- Powerful querying

---

## 17. Limitations

- Rigid schema
- Harder horizontal scaling

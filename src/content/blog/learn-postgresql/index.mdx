## 1. Introduction

PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It uses SQL and extends it with powerful enterprise features.

Often called **Postgres**, it is known for reliability, extensibility, and standards compliance.

---

## 2. Key Features

- ACID compliant transactions
- Advanced indexing
- JSON & JSONB support
- Full-text search
- Extensions support
- Concurrency control (MVCC)

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

Components:

- Server process
- Client applications
- Database cluster
- Tablespaces

Postgres uses a **client-server model**.

---

## 4. Installation & Tools

Common tools:

- psql (CLI)
- pgAdmin (GUI)
- DBeaver

---

## 5. Database Operations

### Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company;
```

### Connect

```sql
\c company
```

### Drop

```sql
DROP DATABASE company;
```

---

## 6. Data Types

Postgres supports advanced types:

- Numeric
- Text
- Boolean
- Date/Time
- UUID
- Array
- JSON/JSONB
- HSTORE

---

## 7. JSONB Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRMARY KEY,
  data JSONB
);

INSERT INTO products (data)
VALUES ('{"name":"Laptop","price":1200}');
```

---

## 8. Indexing

Types:

- B-Tree (default)
- Hash
- GIN
- GiST
- BRIN

Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_json
ON products USING GIN (data);
```

---

## 9. Constraints

- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY
- UNIQUE
- CHECK
- EXCLUSION

---

## 10. Transactions

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id=1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id=2;
COMMIT;
```

---

## 11. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

Allows multiple users to access data without locking conflicts.

---

## 12. Views & Materialized Views

Materialized views store query results physically for performance.

---

## 13. Functions & Stored Procedures

Written in:

- PL/pgSQL
- Python
- Perl
- C

---

## 14. Extensions

Popular extensions:

- PostGIS (geospatial)
- pg_trgm (text similarity)
- uuid-ossp

---

## 15. Replication & Scaling

- Streaming replication
- Logical replication
- Read replicas

---

## 16. Security

- Role-based access
- SSL connections
- Row-level security

---

## 17. Use Cases

- Web applications
- GIS systems
- Financial platforms
- Analytics

---

## 18. Advantages

- Extremely feature rich
- Open source
- Highly extensible

---

## 19. Limitations

- Heavier than MySQL
- More complex tuning

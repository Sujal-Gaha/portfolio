## Black Box Testing

Black box testing (also known as **behavioral or specification-based** testing) focuses on the **external functionality** of the software **without any knowledge of its internal code structure, design, or implementation**.

Testers treat the system as a "black box" and validate it based on inputs, outputs, and requirements.

- **Functional Testing**: Verifies that the software performs as per specified requirements.

  - Unit Testing (functional variant)
  - Integration Testing (functional variant)
  - System Testing
  - Acceptance Testing (including User Acceptance Testing or UAT)
  - End-to-End Testing
  - Smoke Testing (basic build verification)
  - Sanity Testing (quick post-change checks)

- **Non-Functional Testing**: Evaluates aspects like performance, security, and usability.

  - Performance Testing

    - Load Testing
    - Stress Testing
    - Spike Testing
    - Scalability Testing
    - Endurance Testing (or Soak Testing)
    - Volume Testing
    - Stability Testing

  - Usability Testing
  - Security Testing (e.g., black-box penetration testing)
  - Compatibility Testing
  - Localization and Internationalization Testing
  - UI Testing
  - Reliability Testing

- **Regression Testing:** Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality (commonly black box).

- **Other Black Box Techniques:**
  - Equivalence Partitioning
  - Boundary Value Analysis
  - Decision Table Testing
  - State Transition Testing
  - Cause-Effect Graphing
  - Exploratory Testing
  - Ad-hoc Testing
  - Fuzz Testing
  - Alpha Testing (internal user validation)
  - Beta Testing (external user validation)

## White Box Testing

White box testing (also known as structural, glass box, or **code-based** testing) examines the internal structure, logic, and code paths of the software.

Testers have full access to the source code, architecture, and implementation details.

- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Integration Testing** (structural variant): Verifies interactions between modules using code knowledge.
- **Path Testing** (or Basis Path Testing): Ensures all possible execution paths are covered.
- **Loop Testing**: Validates loops (simple, nested, concatenated) for correct behavior.
- **Mutation Testing**: Introduces small code changes to assess test suite effectiveness.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Reviews code without execution for issues like syntax errors or vulnerabilities.
- **Dynamic Code Analysis**: Analyzes code behavior during runtime.
- **Coverage-Based Techniques**:
  - Statement Coverage
  - Branch Coverage (or Decision Coverage)
  - Condition Coverage
  - Multiple Condition Coverage
  - Data Flow Testing
  - Control Flow Testing
- **Penetration Testing** (white-box variant): Full internal access to simluate insider threats.

## Gray Box Testing

Gray box testing is a hybrid approach combining black box (external functionality) and white box (partial internal knowledge).

Testers have limited access to internals, such as architecture diagrams or database schemas, but not full code.

- **Matrix Testing**: Analyzes variables and their risks (business/technical).
- **Pattern Testing**: Identifies defect patterns from past failures.
- **Orthogonal Array Testing**: Uses efficient combinations of inputs for coverage.
- **Regression Testing** (gray-box variant): Re-tests with partial internals.
- **State Transition Testing** (gray-box variant): Tracks state changes with some structural insight.
- **Data Flow Testing**: Examines variable usage and flows.
- **API Testing**: Tests interfaces with partial knowledge of backend logic.
- **Database Testing**: Validates data handling with schema access.
- **Integration Testing** (gray-box variant): Combines modules with limited internals.
- **Penetration Testing** (gray-box variant): Simulates attacks with some system knowledge.
- **Security Testing** (gray-box variant): Partial access to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Testing** (gray-box variant): Some internal metrics for load analysis.
- **Fault Injection Testing**: Introduces faults with partial code awareness.

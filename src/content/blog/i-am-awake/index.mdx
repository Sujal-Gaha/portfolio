## Book I - On Waking and Beginning the Day

- When you rise, remember; you have woken into a world that will one day bury you. Do not waste it.
- This body is fragile, this mind easily led astray. Guard both well.
- Today you will meet man who are ignorant, selfish, distracted, ungrateful. Do not be surprised; to expect otherwise is folly.
- Their ignorance harms them more than it harms you. See them as patients in need of care, not enemies.
- Begin each day resolved; to speak truth, to act with compassion, to guard the mind from excess.

## Book II - On Desire and Fear

- What do men desire? Wealth, praise, pleasure, safety. All of it vanishes. None of it belongs to you.
- Ask; if I gain this, am I freer? If I lose this, am I broken?
- Fear too is empty. It borrows trouble from a future that may never come.
- Desire and fear are two ends of the same chain. Cast off both, and the chain falls.
- The one who sees clearly does not chase, does not run. He stands firm.

## Book III - On Speech and Action

- Let no word escape that does not serve truth or kindness. A tongue unruled is sharper than any sword.
- Speak little, and when you speak, let it be plain.
- Do not delay in doing the good. Life is short, and excuses are endless.
- If a deed cannot be done with integrity, do not do it. Better to abstain than to act wrongly.
- The worth of a man is measured not by what he says of himself, but by how he lessens suffering in others.

## Book IV - On the Mind

- The mind is a citadel. Guard its gates well.
- Thoughts will arrive like visitors, some noble, some vile. Admit only those that strengthen clarity and compassion.
- Do not mistake your thoughts for yourself. You are the space in which they rise and fall.
- A restless mind seeks distractions; a steady mind sees reality.
- Cultivate stillness, not as escape, but as the ground from which right action springs.

## Book V - On Anger and Compassion

- When anger arises, pause. It is fire; if you feed it, it consumes both the burner and the burned.
- See the one who angers you as bound by ignorance. Would you strike a blind man for strumbling into you?
- Anger promises strength but delivers weakness. Compassion promises nothing but leaves you unshaken.
- To repay harm with harm is easy. To meet harm with patience is mastery.

## Book VI - On Solitude and Silence

- Withdraw daily into silence. A few breaths in stillness are worth more than hours of idle distraction.
- In solitude, you see what is within. If it is chaos, do not flee; sit with it until it settles.
- Silence is a teacher greater than many books. Listen.
- Do not fear being alone. You are always in the company of the mind. Train it well, and solitude becomes a friend.

## Book VII - On the Passing of Life

- Each day gone is a page turned, never to return. Do not live as if you had a thousand yet to read.
- Death is not to be feared. It is the nature of all compounded things to dissolve.
- Fear of death belongs to those who have not lived rightly. Live rightly, and you will not tremble.
- What matters is not how long, but how honourably you live.
- The honoured one is not the one who outlives others, but the one who awakens before life passes.

## Book VIII - On the True Honour

- Do not chose honour. What men praise today they forget tomorrow.
- The only true honour is to live in accordance with truth.
- The awakened one does not say, "I am above others.". He says, "I am free of delusion.".
- When you strip away desire, fear, and ignorance, what remains is vast, unshaken, luminous. That is honour enough.
- Remember: throughout heaven and earth, the honoured one is not a man among men, but the awakened mind itself.

## Book IX - On Patience

- All things unfold in their own time. Do not push.
- The mind that hurries stumbles over its own impatience.
- When others delay, err, or fail, remember: they too are bound by circumstance.
- Patience is not weakness. It is the strength that bends without breaking.
- Endure hardships as a tree endures wind; rooted, steady, unshaken.

## Book X - On Impermanence

- All things are transient: bodies, possessions, praise, anger.
- Cling to nothing, for all will pass. Cling only to what cannot pass; the mind awake.
- When grief arises for what is lost, remind yourself: it was never yours to hold.
- To live with awareness of impermanence is to touch freedom.
- Nothing is permanent, nothing is stable. To see this clearly is to cease grasping.

## Book XI - On Discipline

- The body is a tool; the mind is a garden. Both require tending.
- Do not indulge every whim, nor let every thought roam unchecked.
- Daily discipline is not punishment but cultivation of freedom.
- Train yourself in small acts first; greatness grows from tiny seeds.
- If you stumble, return at once. Even the smallest course correction returns you to the path.

## Book XII - On Compassion and Service

- Others suffer; you suffer. See no separation.
- Extend your hand where you can, even in small ways. Each act is a step toward freedom.
- Do not expect gratitude. Compassion is its own reward.
- The awakened mind delights not in possession, but in release.
- The one who sees all beings as equal is already honourable; the world need not agree.

## Book XIII - On Self-Reflection

- Examine yourself each day: thoughts, words, deeds.
- What have you done rightly? What have you allowed to pass unchecked?
- Do not shrink from what you see; acknowledge it, correct it, let it go.
- Self-examination is the mirror in which the mind sees itself clearly.
- Better a hard truth accepted than a comforting illusion cherished.

## Book XIV - On Equanimity

- Joy and sorrow are waves; the mind is the shore Stand unmoved.
- Praise and blame are wind and cloud; see them, but do not cling.
- Maintain balance in abundance and in loss.
- Equanimity is the mark of the one who has ceased chasing the world.
- The mind that rests in equanimity rests in freedom.

## Book XV - On Humility

- True humility is not self-deprecation, but the recognition of one's place in the whole.
- Do not boast of insight or virtue; let them show quietly in action.
- Every man and woman you meet has lessons for you, as you have for them.
- Humility does not shrink; it frees. Pride chains the mind to illusion.

## Book XVI - On Wisdom

- Wisdom is not knowledge alone, but the seeing of things as they are.
- Observe cause and effect. Observe impermanence, suffering, desire, and delusion.
- Learn from experience, but let experience not harden you.
- Wisdom without action is hollow; action without wisdom is blind.
- Seel both, daily, humbly, persistently.

## Book XVII - On Courage

- Fear is natural; courage is choice.
- To face suffering, uncertainty, or death without delusion is true bravery.
- Courage is not absence of fear, but presence of understanding.
- Boldness in service, patience, and truth reveals the mind unshaken.

## Book XVIII - On Simplicity

- Seek not excess, neither of wealth, speech, nor desire.
- Simplicity clears the mind and lightens the heart.
- Let possessions, status, and vanity be tools, not masters.
- The less the mind clings, the freer it is to awaken.

## Book XIX - On Gratitude

- Nothing is owed; nothing is guaranteed.
- See the world as gift, life as privilege, suffering as lesson.
- Gratitude softens the heart and sharpens perception.
- Even the smallest blessings: breath, food, companionship: contain depth beyond measure.

## Book XX - On Awakening

- Do not wait for the extraordinary. Awakening is in the ordinary, full seen.
- Peel away ignorance, craving, and fear. What remains is luminous and unshaken.
- To awaken is not to conquer others, but to free yourself.
- The honoured one is not a title. It is the mind awake, compassionate, and free.
- Return daily to this practice. Small steps, repeated faithfully, lead to the greatest path.
